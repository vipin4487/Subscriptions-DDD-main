This repository is a demo on applying the Domain-Driven Design concepts with EF Core. I have used this for demo to my talk Practical Domain Driven Design with EF Core at NDC Sydney 2020.

The solution structure:
- `Subscriptions.Before`: Project with the legacy code base before any refactoring
- `Subscriptions`: Project after applying all of the refactorings
